Nachos (Nachos Another Completely Heuristic Operating System) is a pedagogical operating system designed to help students learn about fundamental operating system concepts. It's an excellent tool for understanding how an OS manages resources, handles processes, and interacts with hardware.

Key Concepts
Nachos provides a hands-on environment to explore core OS principles, including:

Multithreading: Learning how to manage and schedule multiple threads within a single process.

Synchronization: Understanding how to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity using semaphores, locks, and condition variables.

Virtual Memory: Exploring how the OS manages memory, including page tables and memory protection.

File Systems: Implementing and interacting with file systems to manage data on disk.

Interprocess Communication: Learning how different processes communicate with each other.

Repository Contents
The repository is structured to support these learning goals, with key directories including:

code: Contains the core source code for the Nachos OS, organized by component (e.g., threads, userprog, vm, filesys). This is where you will implement and modify the OS.

c++example: Provides simple C++ examples to help you get started with the development environment.

README.md and INFO: These files contain important documentation and information about the project.

COPYRIGHT: Legal information for the project.

Getting Started
To begin your work with Nachos, you'll need a C++ compiler and a development environment. The Makefile in the repository can be used to build the different components of the OS as you work through the exercises. Follow the instructions in the documentation to compile and run the operating system and its user-level programs.
